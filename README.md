# Android-app---ECG-QRS-Calculator

Android app made using the programming language Kotlin
(available for download through the link below)

This application calculates the exact angle of the QRS-complex axis, based on the Tri-axial method. All you need to do is to insert the value of the complex in Lead 1 & Lead 3!

---LEGAL WARNING---
This application was meant to help with the calculation of the QRS axis, but it is no substitute for the manual interpretation of an ECG made by a physician or another medical professional. Therefore, the responsibility of using this application and handling with the result lies with the user alone.
